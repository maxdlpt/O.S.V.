# OptionStrategyVisualiser
Shows the P&amp;L chart of any options trading strategy of up to 6 legs:
- Legs 1-4: Options contracts
- Leg 5: Equity shares
- Leg 6: Futures contracts

If you scroll down, you can see the individual P&amp;L chart of each individual leg...

There is only one macro (which resets all the programs inputs) but it is not necessary to use the program.
